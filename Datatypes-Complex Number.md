# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## 💻 Program
Add your code
```
x=int(input())
y=int(input())
x=complex(x,y)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```

## Output
<img width="809" height="336" alt="502876189-7c2e8b54-f3e3-4c12-b0b8-28d4a6d54679" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d8fdd4f-9809-4ab8-a31e-4f5b0bd49d45" />

## Result
Thus the above program executed successfully
